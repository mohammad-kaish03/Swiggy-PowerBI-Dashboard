About the Project
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Swiggy's food delivery service data, leveraging Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. The dataset includes information on 100,000 users and 5.2 million menu rows, covering various aspects such as food items, orders, restaurants, and user behavior.13
Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The primary goal is to clean and format the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable analysis. This involves handling null values, dropping unnecessary columns, and renaming columns for clarity.
Insight Generation: 
By analyzing the cleaned data, we aim to uncover trends and insights related to Swiggy's performance, customer behavior, popular food items, and delivery patterns.
Visualization: 
Using Power BI, we create interactive visualizations to present the findings in an accessible and engaging manner. These visualizations help stakeholders make informed decisions and improve the service provided by Swiggy.
Methodology
Data Collection:
 The data was collected through web scraping from Swiggy's website and includes tables related to food items, menus, orders, order types, restaurants, and users.
Data Cleaning: 
Data cleaning involves handling null values, dropping unnecessary columns, and renaming columns to enhance readability and usability.
Data Analysis:
 The cleaned data is analyzed to identify trends and patterns in food delivery orders, customer behavior, and restaurant performance.
Visualization: 
Power BI is used to create visualizations such as graphs, charts, and dashboards that provide a clear and intuitive representation of the analyzed data.
Significance
The insights generated from this project can be used to improve Swiggy's service to customers and restaurants, helping in making data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
